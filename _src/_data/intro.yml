    I am a 3rd year CMI Mechanical Engineering student at Sorbonne Univerisit√©. 
    I am deeply interested in robotics, maths and programming. Since the beginning of 
    highschool I liked problem solving and programming. I've recently begun to love robotics
    and I would like to pursue a career in this field.
