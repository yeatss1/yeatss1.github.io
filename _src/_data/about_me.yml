- head: I love maths and programming 
  body: |
    I really like maths and all its application to solve real-life problems.
    I also enjoy coding on my free time for fun, I sometimes do some Leetcode problems because I love problem solving.
    I learnt C and Python at university. I'm currently learning C++ on my own, im might also try Rust in the near future !
    I recently became interested in Machine Learning and I took a look at books like "An Introduction to Statistical Learning" (https://www.statlearning.com/) and the famous CS229 Lecture Notes from Stanford University.

    
- head: I love learning languages
  body: |
    Maybe because of my bilingual background I always loved learning languages.
    I speak French, Arabic, English and i have basics skills in Chinese (HSK2/3) and Japanese.
    I did 3 years of Japanese in highschool and I really enjoyed it. Recently I got nominated to do an exchange semester at Tohoku University in Sendai, Japan.
    So I'm really glad and happy to come back learning this interesting language!
