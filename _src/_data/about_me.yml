- head: I love robotics
  body: |
      I am deeply interested in robotics and especially in autonomous systems, I recently began documenting myself on SLAM (Simultaneous localization and mapping).
      That's why I want to pursee a career in robotics at the end of my degree.
      I'm currently working on robotics projects on my own, I will post my projects on this site!

- head: I love maths and programming 
  body: |
    I really like maths and all its application to solve real-life problems.
    I also enjoy coding on my free time for fun, I sometimes do some Leetcode problems because I love problem solving.
    I learnt C and Python at university. I'm currently learning C++ on my own, im might also try Rust in the near future!
    I recently became interested in Machine Learning and I took a look at books like "<a href="https://www.statlearning.com/">An Introduction to Statistical Learning</a>" and the famous CS229 Lecture Notes from Stanford University.

    
- head: I love learning languages
  body: |
    Maybe because of my bilingual background I always loved learning languages.
    I speak French, Arabic, English and i have basics skills in Chinese (HSK2/3) and Japanese.
    I did 3 years of Japanese in highschool and I really enjoyed it. Recently I got nominated to do an exchange semester at Tohoku University in Sendai, Japan.
    So I'm really glad and happy to come back learning this interesting language!

- head: I love reading and videos games
  body: |
      In my free time I really enjoy playing videos games and reading. 
      Im currently playing Persona 5 Royal and I really like it for the moment.
      And as for reading I really enjoy Sci-Fi books, but also classics, I enjoy Dostoievsky.
