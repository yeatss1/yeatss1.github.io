  title: Python Developer Intern
  date: July - august 2024
  description: |
    Six-week internship during summer 2024, during which I developed a news management and publishing software. The articles created are directly displayed and accessible to users via the company’s main software, Méd'Oc.

    The tool allows full management of the article database, including adding new articles, editing existing ones, archiving, and deleting them. It also enables scheduled publication, automatic expiration after a set period, and the ability to assign an importance level to each article.

    Throughout this internship, I gained valuable technical skills. I developed the software in Python, using graphical libraries, which helped me better understand how to design user-friendly and functional applications.

    I also strengthened my knowledge of SQL, as well as HTML and XML. I discovered how LDAP and FTP servers work and learned to use LdapAdmin and WinSCP for server management and administration.

    Lastly, I learned to use DBeaver to interact with a PostgreSQL database.
